	<h2>Welcome to Archivatory.</h2>
	<p>Archivatory is a PHP project that gives the content creator a place to host 
		their content for the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) network. The more 
		places their content exists, the better the chance that the work will be 
		available via an IPFS gateway whenever the viewer wishes to consume the 
		media. The idea for this service spun out of the developer's own desire for a 
		list of all the files he uploaded to IPFS from his home server.
		<br /><br />
		After chatting with a few Steemians (cryptocurrency earing content creators), 
		it was clear that the developer was not the only one looking for a more 
		natural way to use IPFS. We are still a very new project with lots of 
		milestones we what to reach to provide as much value for "Archivanauts" all 
		around the galaxy. A long-term milestone for Archivatory is to turn it into 
		a federated service because what's the point if everything hinges on a single 
		server.</p>
	<strong>More features are coming soon so make sure to join us on

	<p class="alert alert-danger"><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Due to the 
nature of IPFS your content may never be able to be removed entirely from 
the network. Even if we delete your file from our server, the hash will 
more than likely still proved the end user with a copy. Please keep this 
in mind when uploading and never upload anything you do not want to be online 
forever.</p>
	<p class="alert alert-warning"><strong>This is still a beta service!</strong> 
Please do not use this as a backup service. We are still in the early stages 
of Archivatory and don't want you to lose your data. Always save a copy on 
an external hard drive and a separate cloud service for redundancy.</p>
